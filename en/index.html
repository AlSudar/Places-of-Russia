            According to VTsIOM polls, 95% of Russians dream of going somewhere,
            but only 36% plan to spend their vacation in their home country.
            Like, what are we here for? at home, have you seen? In fact, Russia
            is a whole universe with the gentle sea of ​​the south, the dense
            forests of the Sayan Mountains and the harsh ice of the plateau
            Putorana. And you can also see all these beauties without millions
            on account, passport and many hours of flights. Like Vera Bashmakova
            is a brave young mother who took three children into her arms, sat
            them in her "Lada" and drove 20 thousand kilometers in her native
            country. We have selected and described some interesting places

                all from behind the mountains: if you drive along the ridge, you
                will see slopes strewn with pine trees, mountain rivers and
                lakes. And if you open in the car windows, you will be able to
                get acquainted with the invisible miracle of these places -

                The climate in Altai is moderate, so it is best to go here in

                fauna. Through the forests Altai moose roam, eagles fly over the

                Everyone knows Baikal as the largest lake in the world. Many
                also know that this is the largest source of fresh water and one

                Of course, this is all true. But Baikal is still an ideal place
                for skiing competitions. This is the kind of sport when the
                skier ties himself to the motorcycle, and the tandem tries to
                develop as fast as possible on ice. In March 2019 at the
                festival "Baikal Mile" was set a world record - 197.011 km/h.
